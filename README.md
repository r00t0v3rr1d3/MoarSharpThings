# SharpThings
Just some more C# tools

As with all code, almost none of this is original work - just grabbing bits and pieces from here and there and trying to put it all together.

I'd recommend using the dsquery over here, as I am helping to update this one. The one in here is just old code I had for reference: https://github.com/breakid/SharpUtils/blob/master/dsquery.cs

steal_token is also reference code, not a full stand-alone tool.
